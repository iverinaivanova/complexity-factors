Diagnostic Thresholds:
k < 0.5: Very good, highly reliable.

0.5 ≤ k < 0.7: Good, generally reliable.

0.7 ≤ k < 1: Potentially problematic, suggesting influential points or model misspecification.

k ≥ 1: Unreliable, indicating that PSIS fails for those points, and exact LOO-CV or model refitting may be needed.


### Evaluation of the predictive performance of the fixed-effects model ###

Computed from 8000 by 17743 log-likelihood matrix.

         Estimate    SE
elpd_loo  -7235.9  79.8
p_loo        15.0   0.3
looic     14471.8 159.6
------
MCSE of elpd_loo is 0.0.
MCSE and ESS estimates assume MCMC draws (r_eff in [0.9, 1.6]).

All Pareto k estimates are good (k < 0.7).
