Diagnostic Thresholds:
k < 0.5: Very good, highly reliable.

0.5 ≤ k < 0.7: Good, generally reliable.

0.7 ≤ k < 1: Potentially problematic, suggesting influential points or model misspecification.

k ≥ 1: Unreliable, indicating that PSIS fails for those points, and exact LOO-CV or model refitting may be needed.
